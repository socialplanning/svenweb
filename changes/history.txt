----------------

 * BZR repositories are now supported. This is much faster than
   SVN. To use, simply add 'svenweb.repo_type=bzr' to your
   paste.deploy configuration.

 * Added a WSGI middleware filter to set a response's Content-type
   header based on the versioned mimetype property of a resource.
   It can be used independent of the rest of svenweb, for example
   if you want to publish the current contents of your versioned
   resources with a static file server. Use like

       [filter:contenttype]
       use = egg:svenweb#content_type
       checkout_dir = /path/to_your/checkout/
       default_content_type = text/plain
       repo_type = bzr

    The 'repo_type' and 'default_content_type' settings are optional.
