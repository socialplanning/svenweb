A little speculative roadmap:

0.3: This version.

0.4: Copying, moving and deleting files. Some refactoring of WSGI components.

0.5: Using REMOTE_USER to determine the username to commit with, or something
     like that. More refactoring of WSGI components.

0.6: RSS or atom feeds. Diffs between arbitrary revisions. More refactoring.
